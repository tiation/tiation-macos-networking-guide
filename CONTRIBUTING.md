## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that promotes a welcoming and inclusive environment. Please read and follow our community guidelines.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tiation-macos-networking-guide.git
   cd tiation-macos-networking-guide
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install.sh
   ```
4. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify.sh
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Git
- Terminal access with sudo privileges
- Network interface management permissions

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Test your changes
./scripts/verify.sh

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add your feature description"
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Shell Scripts**: Follow POSIX shell scripting standards
- **Documentation**: Use clear, concise language with proper formatting
- **Comments**: Include meaningful comments for complex logic
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### Script Guidelines

1. **Start with shebang**: Use `#!/bin/bash` for bash scripts
2. **Set strict mode**: Include `set -euo pipefail`
3. **Use colors**: Implement consistent color coding for output
4. **Include help**: Add `--help` option for user scripts
5. **Validate input**: Check for required parameters and dependencies

### Example Script Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script Description
# Part of Tiation macOS Networking Guide

set -euo pipefail

# Colors for output
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
CYAN='\033[0;36m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Function to print section headers
print_section() {
    echo -e "\n${BLUE}ðŸ“‹ $1${NC}"
    echo -e "${BLUE}$(printf '%*s' ${#1} '' | tr ' ' '-')${NC}"
}

# Main function
main() {
    print_section "Your Feature"
    # Your code here
}

# Run main function
main "$@"
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify.sh
   # Test specific functionality
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Commit with clear message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add IPv6 tunnel monitoring script"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/descriptive-name
   ```
